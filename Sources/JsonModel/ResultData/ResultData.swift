/// `ResultData` is the base protocol for an object that stores data.
///
///  syoung 12/09/2020 `ResultData` is included as a part of the JsonModel module to allow
///  progress and additions to be made to the frameworks used by SageResearch that are independant
///  of the version of https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/SageResearch-Apple.git that is
///  referenced by third-party frameworks. Our experience is that third-party developers will
///  pin to a specific version of SageResearch, which breaks the dependency model that we use
///  internally in our applications.
///
///  The work-around to this is to include a light-weight model here since this framework is fairly
///  static and in most cases where the `RSDResult` is referenced, those classes already import
///  JsonModel. This will allow us to divorce *our* code from SageResearch so that we can iterate
///  independently of third-party frameworks.
